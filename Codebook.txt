Codebook:

The following variables were collected from a smartphone's accelorometer and gyroscope,
with results being derived from a series of subjects performing common actions with the 
smart phone on their person.

The identifying variables in avetab (Average Table) are as follows:
1. "Subjects" - A 1-30 number indicating one of thirty participants on which the tests 
were conducted. 
2. "Activity" - A 1-6 coded id to indicate which of the six following activities the 
observation is of:
	1. Walking
	2. Walking up stairs
	3. Walking down stairs
	4. Sitting
	5. Standing up
	6. Laying down/lying down

These 17 initial variables are variously described as mean, standard deviation, or 
weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency. There are no 
unprocessed variables. 

Data sourcing:
"The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial 
raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) 
were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter 
and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove 
noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity 
acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass 
Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to 
obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these 
three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, 
tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). Fast Fourier Transform 
(FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, 
fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate 
frequency domain signals). "
